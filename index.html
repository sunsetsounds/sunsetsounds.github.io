								<p>Sunset Sounds speakers are designed and engineered with immaculate care and detail. Our mission statement is
									to bring <strong>high fidelity sound</strong> to the portable speaker market... but with a twist. Every speaker is locally <b>handmade</b> with unparalleled
									attention to detail and product finish. They're <strong>3D printed</strong> to allow for a distinctive modern aesthetic,
									 unique grain patterns in 3D printed wood and product finishes, and special filament choice for recyclability/biodegradability.
								</p>
								<h3>Nova Series</h3>
									<p>The Nova Series focuses on uncompromising, superior sound reproduction made for critical listening. All this in an attractive, portable
									package.</p>

									<h5>Overview</h5>
									<p>High quality audio usually goes out the window the moment you step outside. But not Lumino. Lumino’s going right out the door with you,
										 sporting a smooth <strong>3D-printed enclosure</strong> and <strong>sound-reactive LEDs</strong> for some flash.
										 Though slightly larger than the average portable speaker, Lumino has the affordable HiFi audio you’ve been waiting for. Lumino is unparalleled when it comes to <strong>big sound in a compact form factor</strong>.
										 Large drivers and passive radiators give Lumino <b>deep bass response</b> to produce satisfying room-filling sound, and it’s certainly loud enough at a staggering <b>103dB</b> to tag along when you
										 want to chill at the beach or enjoy a picnic. Powered by high capacity lithium-ion batteries, Lumino is capable of playing music all-day long and can get hours of playtime from minutes of charging.
										 Its modern aesthetic is made possible by multiple layers of post-processing, and the hand assembly of internal components requires even more attention from our talented team.
										  As a representation of our extensive research in sound reproduction and speaker transducer design,
                                                                                 Sunset Sounds has engineered a product that can produce HiFi audio wherever your day takes you.

								<h2>Legacy Models</h2>
								<p>This is a short sample of some of the previous models that we've created that did not live up to expectations,
									 were discontinued, or remained as prototypes. A look into the history of Sunset Sounds' speakers and the
								 persistent trial and error we endure in our pursuit of bringing premium sound quality to portable speakers.</p>
								<hr>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/speakers/lbhf.JPG" alt="sunset sounds lbhf-low budget hifi" /></span>
								<h4>LBHF</h4>
								<p>Built in Spring 2020, LBHF was created to be a one off design for a birthday, but we soon realized its full capability.
									 Originally called Low Budget HiFi due to its intention to produce HiFi sound quality at a lower price point and portable form factor, LBHF
									was a name that we eventually became affectionately attached to. One of the most portable designs we had built at this point, LBHF clocked in at
									just under 5 pounds, a major achievement at the time. Still being fully 3D-printed, we took our lessons from Horizon and brought new features and
									revised others. Digital Signal Processing (DSP) in its software form made its grand appearance in this design, allowing us to more effectively
									design our audio architecture. In addition, this was the first design to be simulated in CAD to optimize use of its twin passive radiators.
									LBHF plays an important role in Sunset Sounds' production history, being the Proof of Concept (POC) that would give rise to Lumino/Lumino+ in the summer
									of 2020.</p>

								<hr>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/speakers/horizon.jpg" alt="sunset sounds horizon" /></span>
								<h4>Horizon</h4>
								<p>Hailing in the Summer 2019, this speaker was designed as a portable smart speaker with a voice assistant and many features.
									With sound quality being more of a concern in this design, this was a speaker that was built during a transitional period in Sunset Sounds when we decided
									to focus on bringing HiFi to portable speakers. Being smaller and lighter than Signature at around 14 inches tall and weighing around 8 pounds, Horizon
									proved to be an improvement in portability and convenience, but at the cost of complexity with bass boost circuits created by hand using NE5532 pre-amps
									and a smart home receiver that had Alexa or Google Home functionality.
									Being the first speaker we created utilizing 3D printing and digital signal processing (DSP),
									Horizon serves as a hallmark of learning experience as we learned how to better design and engineer audio systems and electrical
									subsystems that would improve user interaction and listening experience.

								<hr>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/speakers/signature.jpg" alt="sunset sounds signature" /></span>
								<h4>Signature and Signature SE</h4>
								<p>Created in the Summer 2018, this model was the first speaker ever created by Sunset Sounds. It falls far from the speakers we make today,
									but it still is a force to be reckoned with as a party speaker. Featuring four 6.5-inch drivers in an unconventional isobaric loading configuration
									to achieve bass in smaller enclosures, sound-reactive RGB LEDs, and IoT connectivity for remote turn-on with voice assistants. Signature was certainly
								a unique speaker in appearance and functionality, but it was not a viable design due to its extremely high cost and weight at a whopping 15 pounds.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Request a Lumino Demo</h2>

								<h3> How to schedule a demo </h3>
								<p>The purpose of providing a demo is so that you can get a chance to explore Lumino more closely and get a listen before purchasing.
									We can also answer any questions you might have about Lumino!
									Fill out the <a href="#form2">form below</a> to schedule either an in-person meeting or online Zoom meeting!

								</p>

								<h3>In-person Demo Methods</h3>
								<p>We offer two types of methods for in-person demos to give you more flexibility to explore!</p>
								<table>
									<tr>
										<td><h4>Dropoff/Test Drive</h4></td>
										<td><h4>Outdoors Supervised</h4></td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>Take Lumino into your home/permanent residence for 30 minutes or so with a valid legal ID and
											$100 deposit (both returned when demo is over). This method lets you experience Lumino in your ideal setting and with indoor acoustics! We
											will be on standby to assist!
										</td>
										<td> A team member will meet you in a public area and you can listen to a few songs with Lumino to try it out!
											 As it is outside, the acoustics will not be as representative of Lumino's sound quality in critical listening but will allow you to experience
											 the full output of Lumino (without hurting your ears)!
										 </td>
									</tr>
								</table>

								<h3> In-person Demo Restrictions</h3>
								<p>Unfortunately, due to our limited capacity as a small business, we can only offer in-person demos within the region below. If you
									are not located/not willing to travel to this area, we can still offer an online Zoom call to answer questions and see a bit more!
									In special circumstances, we can make some exceptions, so please <a href="#contact">contact us</a> if you are interested!
