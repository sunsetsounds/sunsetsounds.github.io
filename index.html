								<p>Sunset Sounds speakers are designed and engineered with immaculate care and detail. Our mission statement is
									to bring <strong>high fidelity sound</strong> to the portable speaker market. Every speaker is crafted with as much attention as we designed and engineered it with.
									We are building the most unique and high performing audio products, worthy of your eyes and ears :)
								</p>
								<h3>Nova Series</h3>
									<p>The Nova Series focuses on uncompromising, superior sound reproduction made for <b>critical listening</b>. All this in an attractive, portable
									package.</p>

									<span class="image main"><img loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low" src="https://sunsetsoundssf.com/luminov2/images/luminov2flowers.jpg" alt="sunset sounds lumino V2 hifi bluetooth portable speaker" /></span>

									<p> The latest speaker in development, the newest addition to the Nova Series, and a worthy successor to the original Lumino. Lumino V2 is a product of years of persistent trial and error, engineered with meticulous detail. This
										bluetooth speaker has one of the most ambitious audio architecture that stretches the absolute limits of what portable speakers are capable of. Just about every
										aspect of the original Lumino has been revamped and redesigned to take a step closer to perfection. Learn more about Lumino V2's crowdfunding launch by clicking the button

									<h4>Overview</h4>
									<p>High quality audio usually goes out the window the moment you step outside. But not Lumino. Lumino’s going right out the door with you,
										 sporting a smooth <strong>3D-printed enclosure</strong> and <strong>sound-reactive LEDs</strong> for some flash.
										 Though slightly larger than the average portable speaker, Lumino has the affordable HiFi audio you’ve been waiting for. Lumino is unparalleled when it comes to <strong>big sound in a compact form factor</strong>.
										 Large drivers and passive radiators give Lumino <b>deep bass response</b> to produce satisfying room-filling sound, and it’s certainly loud enough at a staggering <b>103dB</b> to tag along when you
										 want to chill at the beach or enjoy a picnic. Powered by high capacity lithium-ion batteries, Lumino is capable of playing music all-day long and can get hours of playtime from minutes of charging.
										 Its modern aesthetic is made possible by multiple layers of post-processing, and the hand assembly of internal components requires even more attention from our talented team.
										  As a representation of our extensive research in sound reproduction and speaker transducer design,
                      Sunset Sounds has engineered a product that can produce HiFi audio wherever your day takes you.

								<h2>Legacy Models</h2>
								<p>This is a short sample of some of the previous models that we've created that did not live up to expectations,
									 were discontinued, or remained as prototypes. A look into the history of Sunset Sounds' speakers and the
								 persistent trial and error we endure in our pursuit of bringing premium sound quality to portable speakers.</p>
								<hr>
								<span class="image main"><img loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low" src="images/speakers/lbhf.JPG" alt="sunset sounds lbhf-low budget hifi" /></span>
								<h4>LBHF</h4>
								<p>Built in Spring 2020, LBHF was created to be a one off design for a birthday, but we soon realized its full capability.
									 Originally called Low Budget HiFi due to its intention to produce HiFi sound quality at a lower price point and portable form factor, LBHF
									was a name that we eventually became affectionately attached to. One of the most portable designs we had built at this point, LBHF clocked in at
									just under 5 pounds, a major achievement at the time. Still being fully 3D-printed, we took our lessons from Horizon and brought new features and
									revised others. Digital Signal Processing (DSP) in its software form made its grand appearance in this design, allowing us to more effectively
									design our audio architecture. In addition, this was the first design to be simulated in CAD to optimize use of its twin passive radiators.
									LBHF plays an important role in Sunset Sounds' production history, being the Proof of Concept (POC) that would give rise to Lumino/Lumino+ in the summer
									of 2020.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low" src="images/speakers/horizon.jpg" alt="sunset sounds horizon" /></span>
								<h4>Horizon</h4>
								<p>Hailing in the Summer 2019, this speaker was designed as a portable smart speaker with a voice assistant and many features.
									With sound quality being more of a concern in this design, this was a speaker that was built during a transitional period in Sunset Sounds when we decided
									to focus on bringing HiFi to portable speakers. Being smaller and lighter than Signature at around 14 inches tall and weighing around 8 pounds, Horizon
									proved to be an improvement in portability and convenience, but at the cost of complexity with bass boost circuits created by hand using NE5532 pre-amps
									and a smart home receiver that had Alexa or Google Home functionality.
									Being the first speaker we created utilizing 3D printing and digital signal processing (DSP),
									Horizon serves as a hallmark of learning experience as we learned how to better design and engineer audio systems and electrical
									subsystems that would improve user interaction and listening experience.

								<span class="image main"><img loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low" src="images/speakers/signature.jpg" alt="sunset sounds signature" /></span>
								<h4>Signature and Signature SE</h4>
								<p>Created in the Summer 2018, this model was the first speaker ever created by Sunset Sounds. It falls far from the speakers we make today,
									but it still is a force to be reckoned with as a party speaker. Featuring four 6.5-inch drivers in an unconventional isobaric loading configuration
									to achieve bass in smaller enclosures, sound-reactive RGB LEDs, and IoT connectivity for remote turn-on with voice assistants. Signature was certainly
								a unique speaker in appearance and functionality, but it was not a viable design due to its extremely high cost and weight at a whopping 15 pounds.</p>

										I'm Derrick and I'm studying Aerospace Engineering at UC Irvine, but my experience extends to software, electrical, and mechanical engineering.

										together some speakers. I would have never guessed that we would make it this far, let alone to call myself a co-founder of something I care so much about.
										I am so proud of how far Sunset Sounds has come and I am proud of my growing team :))
